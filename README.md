## üìö Contents

### 1. **Seasonal Armocromia Model (4 Classes)**
- **Notebook**: [`Fine_tuning_4_Seasons.ipynb`](Fine_tuning_4_Seasons.ipynb)  
- **Description**: This notebook includes the machine learning model trained on the dataset  
  [`/data/dataset/Armocromia/ARMOCROMIA 2. TEST_TRAIN`](data/dataset/Armocromia/ARMOCROMIA%202.%20TEST_TRAIN),  
  with images labeled according to the 4 seasons of armocromia.
- **Trained Model**: [`model_fine_tuning/modello 4 classi/armocromia_4_seasons_resnet50_full.pth`](model_fine_tuning/modello%204%20classi/armocromia_4_seasons_resnet50_full.pth)

### 2. **Subcategory Armocromia Model (12 Classes)**
- **Notebook**: [`Fine_tuning_12_Seasons.ipynb`](Fine_tuning_12_Seasons.ipynb)  
- **Description**: This notebook contains the machine learning model trained on the same dataset  
  [`/data/dataset/Armocromia/ARMOCROMIA 2. TEST_TRAIN`](data/dataset/Armocromia/ARMOCROMIA%202.%20TEST_TRAIN),  
  but with images labeled into 12 armocromia subcategories.
- **Trained Model**: [`model_fine_tuning/modello 12 classi/armocromia_12_seasons_resnet50_full.pth`](model_fine_tuning/modello%2012%20classi/armocromia_12_seasons_resnet50_full.pth)

### 3. **Facial Color Analysis**
- **Notebook**: [`Clustering.ipynb`](Clustering.ipynb)  
- **Description**: This notebook processes face images using:
  - YOLOv8 for face detection
  - Segmentation of detected faces
  - Extraction of top 3 dominant colors using K-Means (3 clusters)
  - Color clustering into 12 groups
  - Visualizations of the clusters with plotted points representing individual images
